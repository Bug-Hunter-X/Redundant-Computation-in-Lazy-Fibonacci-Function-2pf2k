This code suffers from a subtle error related to Haskell's lazy evaluation. The `fib` function calculates Fibonacci numbers. The problem lies in the redundant computation of Fibonacci numbers. For example, `fib 5` will compute `fib 4` and `fib 3`, but `fib 4` also computes `fib 3` again, leading to unnecessary recomputation.

```haskell
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```
